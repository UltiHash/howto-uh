## Getting Started
<a id="#getting-started"></a>
Simply download suitable sample script for your use-case and run it close to the source of data you wish to upload. 

Currently list of available sample scripts is rather short, but we are working on extending it. Star to follow on our updates. 
:Note: expect high rate of changes, it is by no means ready to production usage sample code, only for test and PoC environments.
